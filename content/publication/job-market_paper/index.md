abstract: This paper examines the effect of paid sick leave mandates on nursing home outcomes, with a focus on low paid nursing staff. I use the synthetic control group method and traditional difference-in-differences models along with Nursing Home Compare data and Vital Statistics microdata to estimate the causal effect of psl mandates on nursing home outcomes. I find significant increases in part-time nursing assistant staffing and improvements in resident health and safety. Nursing homes in areas with sick pay mandates also show reductions in the elderly mortality rate. Nursing assistant hours per resident day increase by 2.3 percent driven by a 12 percent increase in the hours for part time workers, and there are no significant reductions in hours of full time nursing assistants. I find improvements along multiple measures of patient health and safety. My calculations show that sick pay mandates helped prevent 4000 nursing home deaths per year among the elderly.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: I study the effect of paid sick leave mandates on long term care facilities and their residents. I find that paid sick leave mandates lead to increases in part time staffing of nursing assistants, improvements in resident health and safety, and a reduction in elderly mortality rate ( preventing on average 4000 deaths per year).
