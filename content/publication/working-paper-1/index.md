abstract: This paper explores the importance of divorce in explaining the gender gap in children’s long term educational outcomes. I find large differences in gender gap between divorced and nondivorced families. Boys perform much worse in divorced families. I use a sibling fixed effects model to find that relative to their sisters, boys in divorced families have lower likelihood of graduating high school and attending college. My results show that boys likelihood of graduating high school declines by 6.4 percentage points if their parents are divorced before they turn 13, and their chances of attending college decline by 12.2 percentage points if they are a teenager at the time of divorce. I find that divorce of parents is unrelated to the gender gap in achievement scores. My event study models show a drop in boys achievement scores relative to girls around the time of divorce.
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper looks at the impact of parent’s divorce on the gender gap in childrens long term labor market outcomes. I find that boys whose parents are divorced are less likely to graduate high school and attend college compared to their sisters.
